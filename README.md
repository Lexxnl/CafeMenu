# CafeMenu App

This is a simple webpage showcasing a cafe menu that I created while learning web development. It was part of a course from [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) to practice HTML and CSS basics. The webpage displays a menu with sections for coffee and desserts, each with a list of items, prices, and descriptions.

## What I Learned
By writing the code for this project, I learned:
- How to structure a webpage using HTML.
- How to use `<section>` and `<article>` to organize content.
- How to display text and images effectively.
- How to style a webpage using CSS.
- How to create clean, easy-to-read layouts for web content.

## Why Learning This Is Helpful
Learning these HTML and CSS basics is important for becoming a web developer because:
1. HTML is the backbone of web development, used for structuring all websites.
2. CSS is essential for styling and formatting web content, making it visually appealing.
3. Employers look for strong HTML and CSS skills, as they are fundamental to web development.
4. This project demonstrates how to organize content and create simple, attractive layouts.

## Acknowledgment
